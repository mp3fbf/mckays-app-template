### Introduction

System prompts play a crucial role in shaping the behavior and responses of AI within our subscription management application. The essence of these prompts lies in guiding the AI to respond accurately and helpfully, enhancing user experience with features such as automated subscription detection and managing interactions in multiple languages and currencies. The application aims to provide a seamless and engaging user interface inspired by the aesthetics of brands like Apple and Airbnb, leveraging AI to minimize manual input and offer insightful suggestions.

### Purpose of System Prompts

The primary purpose of system prompts is to ensure that AI interactions within the app are intuitive and effective. Prompts guide the AI to understand user queries, manage subscriptions, and provide cost-saving suggestions, all while facilitating a smooth, responsive user experience. Crafting these prompts with clarity and specificity is essential for them to be effective, as it helps the AI interpret user intentions accurately and respond with the appropriate context.

### Prompt Structure and Guidelines

Prompts should be structured in a clear and concise manner, following a consistent format to facilitate AI understanding. It's crucial to use everyday language that aligns with the AI's tasks, ensuring that the language matches the app's functionalities like recognizing user subscriptions automatically. Guidelines for writing prompts include using direct language, providing context for any advanced AI functionalities like cost analysis, and ensuring all prompts are contextually relevant to the app's tasks.

### Core System Prompts

Core system prompts include prompts for natural language input of subscription details and cost analysis, detection of subscription types, and interaction prompts for managing alerts and notifying users of upcoming payments. For example, a prompt might ask the AI to "List all subscriptions ending this month" or "Provide cost-saving suggestions based on current market rates." These prompts ensure the AI can manage and recommend actions on user subscriptions effectively.

### Role-Specific Prompts

Role-specific prompts are designed to tailor the AI’s behavior depending on the user’s interaction context—whether managing subscriptions, interacting with support, or using the app’s features. For instance, when acting as a support assistant, the AI might use prompts like "Guide the user to update their billing information." When functioning as a personal assistant, prompts might include "Suggest three alternative subscriptions that offer similar services at a lower cost."

### Dynamic Prompts

Dynamic prompts change based on user inputs or specific contexts, allowing the AI to tailor its responses to the situation. These might include prompts that adjust based on user currency preferences or language settings. For example, "Notify me in en-US format about subscription renewals" dynamically adapts the AI’s output to match user-specified settings.

### Error Handling Prompts

Error handling prompts are critical for guiding the AI when issues arise. These assist in maintaining a smooth user experience by providing instructions on what to do if a subscription is unrecognizable or if there’s a misunderstanding. Instances like "Apologize and ask the user to re-enter subscription details" ensure that the AI handles errors gracefully, keeping users informed and less frustrated.

### Feedback and Improvement

Collecting user feedback on prompt effectiveness is integral to refining the AI interactions. Users can provide feedback through the app on prompt accuracy and responsiveness, allowing continuous iteration and enhancement of these prompts. This feedback loop helps in addressing common issues and improving AI behavior in future updates.

### Conclusion and Overall Summary

System prompts are indispensable in guiding AI behavior, ensuring the subscription management app delivers an engaging and user-friendly experience. These carefully crafted prompts help differentiate our app by facilitating AI-driven insights and user interactions in a logical, responsive manner, in line with the app's design inspirations and technical capabilities.
