# File Structure Document

## Introduction

A well-organized file structure is crucial for developing and maintaining the subscription management app, ensuring that the project runs smoothly and supports collaboration among developers. The clear organization of files aids in locating resources, understanding code dependencies, and enhancing productivity. As described, the project will handle multi-currency subscription management, leverage AI for automation, and provide a user-friendly experience inspired by leading design principles. This document will outline the file structure designed to support these goals.

## Overview of the Tech Stack

The tech stack for this project includes Next.js 14 as the frontend framework, utilizing TypeScript for static typing and Tailwind CSS for styling. Shadcn/UI and Radix UI provide additional component and accessibility support, while Lucide Icons offer iconography. The backend is powered by Supabase, handling database management, authentication, and storage. AI models like GPT-4O and Claude 3.5 Sonnet enhance user input features and suggestions. The use of modern technologies such as these directly influences the file structure, creating modular and reusable components that promote maintainability and scalability.

## Root Directory Structure

The root directory of the project contains essential files and directories that lay the groundwork for the application. Key directories include `src` for source code, `public` for static assets, and `config` for configuration files. Important files at this level include:

*   `package.json` to manage dependencies.
*   `README.md` providing an overview and documentation of the project.
*   `.env` files for environment-specific variables ensuring secure operations and configurations per deployment environment.

## Frontend File Structure

The frontend code resides primarily in the `src` directory, meticulously organized to maintain modularity and reusability. Subdirectories include:

*   `components`: Houses individual and shared UI components implemented in Next.js and styled with Tailwind CSS, ensuring consistent design and functionality.
*   `pages`: Contains routing information and individual pages that form the application structure, using Next.js dynamic routes.
*   `styles`: Centralized location for global styles and Tailwind configurations, promoting consistent theming across different components.
*   `assets`: Stores static files like images and fonts used throughout the front end.
*   `utils`: Contains utility functions that support various frontend functionalities, helping with tasks such as currency conversion and date formatting. This structured approach facilitates ease of development, making it easier to update UI components and styles while supporting internationalization in line with user preferences.

## Backend File Structure

The backend file structure emphasizes scalability and maintenance, with key components hosted on Supabase. Essential directories include:

*   `controllers`: Manage the application's logic and control data flow between models and views, ensuring that the layered architecture remains intact.
*   `models`: Define data structures and relationships for subscription management, supporting complex queries and data manipulation.
*   `routes`: Set up API routes and endpoints to manage data transmissions between the client and server.
*   `services`: Implement business logic, such as automated subscription detection and AI-driven insights, crucial for maintaining operational efficiency. This design pattern ensures that changes can be made efficiently without impacting the overall application functionality.

## Configuration and Environment Files

Configuration and environment files provide the foundation for secure operations and adaptability to different environments. Environment files (`.env`) store sensitive information like API keys and database credentials, ensuring that such data is not exposed in source code. Configuration files help manage runtime settings for various environments (development, staging, production) and build processes, streamlining the deployment pipeline.

## Testing and Documentation Structure

Testing is crucial for maintaining quality and performance, housed in a `tests` directory. It contains unit and integration tests, ensuring new changes do not disrupt existing functionality. Documentation is maintained within the `docs` folder, providing guidelines, API references, and user manuals. This structure allows for thorough quality assurance and facilitates documentation updates, promoting effective knowledge sharing among team members.

## Conclusion and Overall Summary

In summary, the file structure of this subscription management app is crafted to support collaborative development, ease of maintenance, and scalability through strategic organization. This structure brings clarity and efficiency to the project by compartmentalizing the frontend and backend components. The incorporation of advanced technologies and frameworks supports the core objectives of the app, differentiating it from other projects through its commitment to design excellence, user engagement, and data management capabilities.
