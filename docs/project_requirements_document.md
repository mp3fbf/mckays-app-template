# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Overview

The project at hand is the development of a sophisticated web application designed for managing multiple subscriptions seamlessly and efficiently. The application is targeted towards tech-savvy individuals, young professionals, and digital enthusiasts who typically manage a wide array of subscriptions across various platforms and services. The main aim of this project is to alleviate common problems associated with subscription management such as tracking renewal dates, dealing with multiple currencies, and identifying cost-saving alternatives. The web app utilizes automated tools to detect and manage user subscriptions, thereby minimizing the manual effort and time investment required by users. Moreover, it leverages modern design principles inspired by leading brands such as Apple, Bauhaus, Airbnb, and Vercel to ensure a visually appealing and user-centric experience. A key component of the project employs AI to support natural language inputs and enhance user engagement with predictive text and cost-saving analysis.

The core objectives of the web app are clear: provide multi-currency support, automate subscription detection, customize renewal alerts, and incorporate AI-driven analytics for better financial management. Developed with a scalable and efficient backend, the app aims to engage users with a beautifully designed user interface and smooth functionality from initial launch. Its success criteria hinge on achieving a user-friendly experience, accurate automated subscription tracking, and insightful analytics that encourage users to optimize their subscription usage effectively. The use of advanced technologies and a freemium-tiered monetization model are strategic decisions to both attract users initially and retain them through premium features.

## In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   Multi-currency support (USD, BRL, Euro, Pounds)
*   Automated subscription detection via financial APIs like Plaid or Yodlee
*   User customization for date formats, languages (en-US/pt-BR), and alert preferences
*   AI-driven natural language processing for subscription input and cost analysis
*   Comprehensive dashboard with key subscription details
*   Integration with communication tools like email, WhatsApp, and Telegram
*   A freemium pricing model with tiered subscription benefits
*   In-app support mechanisms including FAQs and AI-powered chat support

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Initial deployment as mobile apps (planned post web version stabilization)
*   Spoken command inputs or voice recognition functionalities
*   Advanced multi-user roles beyond standard and potential admin

## User Flow

Upon accessing the web app, a new user is greeted with a sign-up prompt, allowing them to create an account using their email. Once logged in, the user is directed to customize their app preferences by selecting their preferred language and currency options. The user then lands on the main dashboard, which provides an overview of all active subscriptions, showing subscription names, logos, billing intervals, and upcoming renewal dates.

From the dashboard, users can click through to the Subscription Manager where they have detailed editing options for each subscription, including name, billing interval, price, and payment methods. The Alerts Page is accessible from here, presenting notifications for renewals and cost-saving suggestions. Through the Settings menu, users can further refine their preferences, including alert timing and notification methods. A login/signup interface ensures secure authentication and the app maintains a pleasant user experience with aesthetic inspirations from renowned design styles, providing smooth, engaging animations throughout the journey.

## Core Features

*   **Multi-Currency Support:** Allowing subscriptions in various currencies (USD, BRL, Euro, Pounds).
*   **Automated Subscription Detection:** Utilizing financial APIs for secure and efficient subscription identification.
*   **Customized Alerts:** Options for user-defined notification schedules for renewals and payments.
*   **AI-Driven Insights:** Use of GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet for natural language processing and predictive analysis.
*   **Data Visualization:** Employing aesthetic design principles for clear and engaging data displays.
*   **User-Friendly Experience:** Incorporating gamification and smooth animation features to enhance UI.
*   **Email & Messaging App Integration:** Adding subscriptions via extensions like WhatsApp, Email, and Telegram.
*   **Feedback Mechanism:** Users can report detection errors or suggestions directly within the app.

## Tech Stack & Tools

*   **Frontend:** Next.js 14 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS for styles, shadcn/UI for UI components, Radix UI for accessibility enhancements, Lucide Icons for visual consistency.
*   **Backend & Storage:** Supabase for database management, user authentication, and file storage.
*   **AI Models:** GPT-4O and Claude 3.5 Sonnet for natural language processing tasks and intelligent suggestions.
*   **IDE & Plugins:** Cursor for AI-driven coding support and real-time development assistance.
*   **Supplementary Tools:** V0 by Vercel for modern frontend component building.

## Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:** Responsive design ensuring intuitive and swift navigation, robust database queries for efficient load times.
*   **Security:** Implementation of secure authentication protocols and encryption methods, especially for API integrations accessing financial data.
*   **Compliance:** Adherence to relevant data protection regulations such as GDPR, ensuring user data privacy and security.
*   **Usability:** Application interface should be accessible, offering clear pathways for users of various technical proficiencies.

## Constraints & Assumptions

*   **Authorship and Confidentiality:** Reliance on secure APIs for subscription detection, assuming continued availability and cooperation from third-party services.
*   **User Input:** Assumes text-based input is sufficient for user interaction, delaying spoken command capabilities.

## Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **API Rate Limits:** Potential limitations due to third-party API call restrictions that may affect real-time subscription detections.
*   **Data Privacy:** Ensuring robust encryption and secure handling of financial data, maintaining user trust and adherence to legal standards.
*   **Localization Challenges:** Maintaining consistency and accuracy in multi-language and multi-currency functionalities.
*   **Automated Detection Accuracy:** Balancing the need for sophisticated algorithms to ensure subscription detections are accurate, providing options for user verification and feedback.

Addressing these challenges with strategic development and user engagement will be critical to the success of the subscription management app, paving the way for potential future enhancements such as voice command capabilities or expanding into mobile platforms.
